 Self-Monitoring Auto-Immune disease(AI-MATE) Application
 
 •	Requirements gathering, analysis and planning to develop a web-application that could be used by patients affected from Auto-Immune disease.
•	Implemented image compression, resizing, uploading and various image processing algorithms for features like Hand-drift and Urine/Protein analysis. Implemented reminder functionality and integrated it with Google Calendars 
•	Automated test cases for UI testing using Selenium to identify and fix bugs, hence improving application performance

NOTE : Due to a non-disclosure agreement with the client for the code, I couldn't share the code on GitHub. Please refeer the AI-Mate Final Presentation to look over how the web-app works.
